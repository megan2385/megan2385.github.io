    <h1>Hello! I'm Megan!</h1>
    <h2>I'm a sophmore doing a CTD major.</h2>
    <p>My pronouns are she/her! I love art, video games, and frogs!</p>
    <p>What I want to get from this course is being able to make a nice looking website that I could one day use for something like a portfolio.</p>
    <p>I'd like to be able to add video players or music to my website. I'd also like the skills to make my website feel like a piece of art!</p>
    <p>I think a really cool website is the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared website that has all their episodes. It's one of my favorite webseries!</p> 
    <p><strong>Check it out here!:</strong></p>
